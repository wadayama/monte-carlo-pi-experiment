# Numerical Experiment Instructions

## Purpose
This markdown file serves as an instruction manual for the numerical experiments planned to be conducted in this folder. Please read this content carefully and implement accordingly.

This project uses Python for program development. During development, refer to the Python development guidelines @python_dev_guide.md for implementation.

## Experiment Objective
As practice for experimental program development using Claude Code, conduct the following experiment. The content involves experimental verification of the Central Limit Theorem.

## Experiment Content
* Calculate the sum of n uniformly distributed random numbers in the range [0,1].
* Perform the above sum calculation M times.
* Display the results as a histogram.

# Expected Output Results
* Display a histogram and save the results as a PDF file.

## Important Notes
* When encountering unclear points during implementation, ask the user while implementing.
* During implementation, refer to the Python development guidelines @python_dev_guide.md for implementation.
